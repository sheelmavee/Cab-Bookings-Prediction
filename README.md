# Cab_Bookings_Prediction
Testing different models and fine tuning algorithms for highest performance in predicting the cab bookings.


Different pre - processing tasks were assigned to perform on the data provided.
After that we had to analyse different models accuracy score and then fine tuning them to give the best possible results using tuning algorithms and come up with the model which shows the highest accuracy.
